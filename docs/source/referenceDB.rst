Suggested Reference Databases
=============================

Dependent on where your sequences originate (e.g. ITS, 16S, LSU), you will need to have an appropriate 
database with which to classify them.

For Fungi or all Eukaryotes, the `UNITE <https://unite.ut.ee/>`_ database is preferred. The format of the reference database to use with 
CONSTAx is one of those under the `General <https://unite.ut.ee/repository.php`_ fasta format.

For Bacteria and Archaea, we recommend the `SILVA <https://www.arb-silva.de/no_cache/download/archive/current/Exports/`_ reference database. 
The `SILVA_XXX_SSURef_tax_silva.fasta.gz` file can be gunzip-ped and used.
